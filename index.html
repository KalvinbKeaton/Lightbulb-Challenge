    I love playing videogames and playing volleyball. Videogames are something that have been with me my whole life, and i'ts something that has made me many friends. Volleyball is also one of my favorite things to do and I love to play with friends. I'm even on my volleyball team for school and play on varisty. Volleyball has made me a bunch of friends, from all the pickups, and games that I've gone to, and it holds a special place in my heart.
